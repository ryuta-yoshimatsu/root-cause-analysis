# MAGIC # Create a model serving endpoint for online causal analysis
# MAGIC
# MAGIC With our structural causal model registered in Unity Catalog, the final step is deploying it behind a Model Serving endpoint. This setup is crucial for conducting online causal analyses, such as anomaly attribution, in real time. Identifying the root causes of defective products quickly helps minimize the costs associated with their impact.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This notebook demonstrates how to streamline Python-based model serving workflows. It uses [Databricks SDK](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/sdk-python.html) for creating a model serving endpoint, updating the endpoint configuration to use specific model versions, making prediction requests, and deleting endpoints when needed.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC See the notebook `01_causal_graph` for a recommended cluster configuration.

# MAGIC ## Define variables and set MLflow experiment

# COMMAND ----------

import mlflow

# Set the registry URI to Databricks Unity Catalog
mlflow.set_registry_uri("databricks-uc")

# Create an MLflow client to interact with the tracking server
client = mlflow.tracking.MlflowClient()

# COMMAND ----------

user_name = spark.sql("SELECT current_user()").collect()[0][0]
first_name = user_name.split(".")[0]

# Set up Unity Catalog
catalog = f'causal_solacc_{first_name}'     # Change this to your catalog name
schema = f'rca'                             # Change this to your schema name
model = f"manufacturing_rca"                # Change this to your model name
log_schema = "log"                          # A schema within the catalog where the inferece log is going to be stored

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Set up configurations
# MAGIC Based on your latency and throughput requirements, it’s important to select the appropriate `workload_type` and `workload_size`. The `auto_capture_config` block defines where to store inference logs, including the requests and responses from the endpoint, along with their timestamps.

# COMMAND ----------

# Get the champion model version
champion_version = client.get_model_version_by_alias(model_name, "champion")
model_version = champion_version.version

# Define the JSON configuration for the model serving endpoint
my_json = {
    "name": model_serving_endpoint_name,
    "config": {
        "served_models": [
            {
                "model_name": model_name,

                "scale_to_zero_enabled": "true",
            }
        ],

            "table_name_prefix": model_serving_endpoint_name,
        },
    },
}

# Ensure the schema for the inference table exists
_ = spark.sql(
    f"CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS {catalog}.{log_schema}"

    f"DROP TABLE IF EXISTS {catalog}.{log_schema}.`{model_serving_endpoint_name}_payload`"

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Wait for the endpoint to be ready
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The `wait_for_endpoint()` function below, defined in the following command, retrieves and returns the status of the serving endpoint. We will wait until the endpoint is fully ready.

# Plot the anomaly attribution scores
dowhy.utils.bar_plot({k: v for k, v in result.items()}, ylabel='Anomaly attribution score')

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Delete the endpoint
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Although the endpoint is configured to scale down to zero when there is no incoming traffic, let’s clean up and delete the endpoint:

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Wrap up
# MAGIC
# MAGIC That’s it! In this notebook, we took our structural causal model registered in Unity Catalog and deployed it behind a Model Serving endpoint. Additionally, we explored how to interact with this endpoint using the Databricks SDK.
