# MAGIC ## Load the causal graph
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now, let's load the causal graph defined in the previous notebook. We will integrate this graph with generative models that describe the data generation process at each node to construct a structural causal model (SCM).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The causal graph can be loaded using MLflow:

# COMMAND ----------

# Find all the runs from the prior notebook for causal discovery
client = mlflow.MlflowClient()
experiment = mlflow.get_experiment_by_name(experiment_name)
discovery_runs = client.search_runs(
    experiment_ids=[experiment.experiment_id], 
    filter_string="attributes.run_name='causal_graph'",
    order_by=["start_time DESC"],
    max_results=1,
    )

# Make sure there is at least one run available
assert len(discovery_runs) == 1, "Run the previous notebook: 01_causal_graph"

# The only result should be the latest based on our search_runs call
latest_discovery_run = discovery_runs[0]
latest_discovery_run.info.artifact_uri

# Load the graph artifact from the run
local_path = mlflow.artifacts.download_artifacts(latest_discovery_run.info.artifact_uri + "/graph/causal_graph.pickle")

with open(local_path, "rb") as f:
    causal_graph = pickle.load(f)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC To verify, let's plot the graph:

# COMMAND ----------

dowhy.gcm.util.plot(causal_graph, figure_size=(20, 20))

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Load the dataset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Next, we will load the synthetic dataset we generated in the previous notebook.

# COMMAND ----------

# Define the Delta table name
table_name = f"{catalog}.{schema}.data_manufacturing"

# Query to retrieve the version history of the Delta table
version_query = f"DESCRIBE HISTORY {table_name}"

# Get the latest version of the Delta table
version = spark.sql(version_query).collect()[0][0]

# Read the Delta table as of the latest version
sdf = spark.read.format("delta").option("versionAsOf", version).table(table_name)

# Convert the Spark DataFrame to a pandas DataFrame
pdf = sdf.toPandas()

# Display the first few rows of the pandas DataFrame
pdf.head()

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Assign causal mechanisms to the graph
# MAGIC
# MAGIC As we can see, we have one sample for each processed product, including all the variables in the causal graph.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While we have defined the causal graph, we still need to assign generative models to its nodes. These models can either be manually specified and configured if necessary or automatically inferred from the data using heuristics. Here, we will use the latter approach:

# COMMAND ----------

from dowhy import gcm
np.random.seed(1)

# Create the structural causal model object
scm = gcm.StructuralCausalModel(causal_graph)

# Automatically assign generative models to each node based on the given data
auto_assignment_summary = gcm.auto.assign_causal_mechanisms(
  scm, 
  pdf, 
  override_models=True, 
  quality=gcm.auto.AssignmentQuality.GOOD
  )

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Whenever possible, it is best practice to assign models based on prior knowledge, as this ensures they closely reflect the underlying physics of the domain rather than relying on data-specific nuances. However, in this case, we have asked DoWhy to handle this task for us.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once the models are automatically assigned, we can print a summary to gain insights into the selected models:

# COMMAND ----------

print(auto_assignment_summary)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC The auto-assignment function evaluates both linear and non-linear models for non-root nodes, considering Additive Noise Models (ANMs) for continuous data (e.g., position_alignment) and Discrete ANMs for discrete data (e.g., dimensions), selecting the best-performing model based on metrics such as MSE.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Fit causal models to the data
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After assigning a model to each node, we need to learn the parameters of the model. We fit the causal model to the dataset.

# COMMAND ----------

gcm.fit(scm, pdf)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Evaluate the fitted causal models
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The fit method trains the generative models for each node by learning their parameters. Let's examine the performance of these causal mechanisms and evaluate how well they capture the underlying distribution:

# COMMAND ----------

print(
  gcm.evaluate_causal_model(
  scm,
  pdf, 
  compare_mechanism_baselines=True, 
  evaluate_invertibility_assumptions=True)
  )

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Broadly, the `gcm.evaluate_causal_model` method performs four types of evaluations on the fitted graph: evaluation of causal mechanisms, assessment of the invertible functional causal model assumption, evaluation of the generated distribution, and analysis of the causal graph structure. While we won't delve into the details of these tests here, we encourage users to check DoWhy's [documentation](https://www.pywhy.org/dowhy/v0.11.1/user_guide/modeling_gcm/model_evaluation.html) and [source code](https://github.com/py-why/dowhy/blob/main/dowhy/gcm/model_evaluation.py) for a deeper understanding.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In our case, using a synthetically generated dataset, the fitted causal mechanisms largely align well with the data generation process. The above graph provides strong evidence that the causal graph structure identified in the model is capturing real and meaningful relationships in the data, rather than random associations. The extremely low p-values and clear separation between the original and permuted graphs suggest that the causal graph has successfully identified genuine structural relationships in the system being studied. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC However, in real-world scenarios, datasets are often messier, have smaller sample sizes, or exhibit lower signal-to-noise ratios. In addition, the graph might be missing key confounders. For these reasons, it’s crucial to understand the evaluation techniques mentioned above and recognize how each test addresses specific issues.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If the evaluation results indicate signs of misspecification, you can choose to revisit steps such as data collection, causal discovery, or modeling of causal mechanisms, or proceed with your analysis despite the issues. The evaluations provide insights into the quality of the causal model but they should not be overinterpreted, as some causal relationships are inherently challenging to model. Additionally, many algorithms demonstrate robustness to misspecifications or suboptimal performance of causal mechanisms.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Register the fitted causal graph to Unity Catalog using MLflow
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once we are satisfied with our causal models, we can register it with Unity Catalog to ensure proper governance. Later, we will load this model to perform causal analysis. MLflow does not natively support the `gcm.StructuralCausalModel` (SCM) object, but we can simply wrap the SCM object using `mlflow.pyfunc.PythonModel` and log it with MLflow instead.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ## Wrap up
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This concludes the second notebook. Here, we assigned causal mechanisms to the causal graph defined in the previous notebook. We then fitted the graph on the dataset and evaluated the fitted graph to assess how well it captures the underlying data generation process. Finally, we registered the fitted graph in Unity Catalog using MLflow for future use. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In the next notebook, we will leverage the fitted graph to conduct causal analyses.
